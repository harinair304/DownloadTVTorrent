Setup a schedule and automatically download TV shows by running it as a cron job

A python script and a configuration file. You add your favorite shows to the file according to the day they air and the script then crawls through a torrent site to download episodes of it. For best results run it as a cron job everyday. That way you don't need to worry about manually downloading your shows every day.
